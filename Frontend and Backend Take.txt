Frontend and Backend Take-home assignment
App Name: LinkVault
Objective
Design and implement a full stack web application that allows users to upload text or files
and share them securely with others using a generated link. Access to the uploaded
content must be restricted strictly to users who possess the link, similar to link-based
access in systems like Google Drive, Pastebin and TinyURL.
Problem Statement
You are required to build a Pastebin-like web application where users can:
1.​ Upload plain text or any type of file (either one for a single share)
2.​ Receive a unique, shareable URL after upload.
3.​ Share this URL with others who can:
○​ View and copy the text, or
○​ Download the uploaded file.
4.​ Ensure that the content is not accessible without the exact link.
5.​ Automatically expire and delete content after a specified duration.
No authentication or login system is required for the base implementation.
Functional Requirements
1. Upload Functionality
●​ Users should be able to:
○​ Upload plain text, or
○​ Upload a file (any format).
●​ Only one of the two (text or file) is required per upload.
2. Link Generation
●​ Upon successful upload, the server must generate a unique, hard-to-guess URL.
●​ This URL should be returned to the user and displayed on the frontend.
●​ The URL must be shareable and reusable until the content expires.
3. Access Control
●​ Content must be accessible only via the generated link.
●​ There should be no public listing, search, or browsing of uploaded content.●​ Attempting to access content without a valid link should result in:
○​ A 403 (Bad Request) response.
4. Expiry Handling
●​ Users may optionally specify an expiry date and time during upload.
●​ If no expiry is specified:
○​ The content must expire 10 minutes after upload by default.
●​ After expiry:
○​ The content should no longer be accessible.
○​ The system should handle expired links gracefully.
5. Content Retrieval
●​ For text uploads:
○​ Display the text in a readable format.
○​ Provide a copy-to-clipboard option.
●​ For file uploads:
○​ Provide a download option.
Non-Functional Requirements
●​ The application should be:
○​ Secure against direct URL guessing.
○​ Efficient in handling uploads and downloads.
○​ Cleanly structured with separation of concerns (frontend, backend, database).
●​ API responses should follow proper HTTP status codes.
●​ Input validation must be implemented on both frontend and backend.
●​ The UI of the application must be good (easy-to-use and clean)
API Expectations (High-Level)
Students are expected to design RESTful APIs, for example:
●​ Upload endpoint
●​ Content retrieval endpoint via unique ID
●​ Optional cleanup mechanism for expired content
Exact API design decisions are left to the student.Additional Features (Optional / Bonus / To make this a Resume-ready
project)
Students may implement all or any of the following:
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
Password-protected links
One-time view links
Maximum download/view count
Manual delete option
Authentication and user accounts
File size limits and type validation
Background job for automatic deletion of expired content
User-based access control after authentication is implemented
Tech Stack Constraints
Students must use the following stack:
Frontend
●​ React + Vite
●​ Tailwind CSS
Backend
●​ Node.js
●​ Express.js
Database
●​ Any database of the student’s choice​
(e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)
Hint: Use an Object Store like Firebase Storage bucket and obtain the link to the uploaded
files and store that in the DB. (Maybe this can be asynchronously using a cron job or
synchronously (student’s choice)).
Deliverables
●​ Source code (frontend and backend folders clearly separate from each other)
●​ Database schema or model definitions
●​ README file including (strictly must not be AI generated):
○​ Setup instructions
○​ API overview
○​ Design decisions○​ Assumptions and limitations
●​ Data flow diagram from the user upload to DB storage (The High-Level architecture
of the application on Pen and Paper or using Online tools like Whimsical)
●​ All the above deliverables are to be uploaded to GitHub and the repository link
has to be submitted using the Google Form provided on Moodle.
●​ Do not add node_modules folder to git. Use the following .gitignore files in
case your folder doesn’t have them pre-generated by npm.
